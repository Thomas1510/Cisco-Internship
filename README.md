# Cisco Virtual Internship: Cyber Shield - Defending the Network

## Overview
From May to July 2024, I successfully completed the Cisco Virtual Internship, where I tackled various real-world cybersecurity and network challenges using Cisco Packet Tracer. This repository documents my journey, solutions, and key deliverables for the internship problem statement: **Cyber Shield - Defending the Network.**

## Problem Statement
The internship focused on three main areas:

### **1. Campus Network Security**
- **Tasks:**
  - Analyze the existing network topology of a college campus.
  - Map the network using Cisco Packet Tracer.
  - Identify vulnerabilities and propose security countermeasures.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Network topology diagram.
  - Security assessment report with risks and solutions.

### **2. Hybrid Work Environment Design**
- **Tasks:**
  - Design a secure hybrid working model for faculty and students.
  - Update the network topology to include new components.
  - Propose solutions balancing security and accessibility.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Enhanced network topology.
  - Report explaining the design decisions, risks, and advantages.

### **3. Internet Content Restriction**
- **Tasks:**
  - Propose a solution to restrict access to irrelevant websites.
  - Implement content filtering in the network design.
  - Write policies to enforce access controls.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Updated topology with content filtering.
  - List of access control policies.

### **Cloud Security**
- **Tasks:**
  - Improve scalability and availability of an e-commerce platform.
  - Design countermeasures to handle DDoS attacks and ensure service uptime.
  - Create a revised system architecture diagram.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Scalable and secure system architecture.
  - Risk analysis report detailing mitigation strategies.

## Tools Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: For simulating and visualizing network topologies.

## Repository Contents
- `Topologies/`: Contains all the Packet Tracer (.pkt) files for network diagrams.
- `Reports/`: Includes detailed reports on security assessments and design decisions.
- `Policies/`: Documents listing the access control and content filtering policies.

## Key Achievements
- Analyzed and enhanced network topologies with a focus on security and efficiency.
- Designed solutions for hybrid work environments with secure access control.
- Mitigated potential DDoS attacks through robust cloud architecture design.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/cisco-virtual-internship
   ```
2. Open the `Topologies/` folder in Cisco Packet Tracer to explore the network designs.
3. Refer to the `Reports/` folder for detailed explanations and solutions.

## Conclusion
This internship provided hands-on experience in cybersecurity and network design, helping me build a strong foundation for tackling real-world challenges. Feel free to explore the repository and reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
